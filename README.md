# Dmtool

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/dmtool`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dmtool'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install dmtool

## Usage

To initiate my application, type shotgun to access the information needed to go to the correct url.

When the local host is connected and the url is typed, you will begin at the welcome page for my application.

You need to either log in or sign up to access the remainder views.

After doing so, you will be taken to the view which displays all characters.

You may either go back to the home page, view all characters, create a character, log out, or edit characters if they were created by you.

If you click on a characters name, you will be brought to their unique view.

At this view you may delete the character if it was created by you.

You may only edit or delete your own created characters.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
